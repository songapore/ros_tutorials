## 15.3 Building your nodes
We use CMake as our build system and, yes, you have to use it even for Python nodes. This is to make sure that the autogenerated Python code for messages and services is created.

Go to your catkin workspace and run catkin_make.
```
# In your catkin workspace
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```
