## 15.1 Writing a Service Node
Here we'll create the service ("add_two_ints_server") node which will receive two ints and return the sum.

Change directory into the beginner_tutorials package, you created in the earlier tutorial, creating a package:
```
$ roscd beginner_tutorials
```
Please make sure you have followed the directions in the previous tutorial for creating the service needed in this tutorial, creating the AddTwoInts.srv (be sure to choose the right version of build tool you're using at the top of wiki page in the link).
### 15.1.1 The Code
Create the scripts/add_two_ints_server.py file within the beginner_tutorials package and paste the following inside it:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python

from beginner_tutorials.srv import *
import rospy

def handle_add_two_ints(req):
    print "Returning [%s + %s = %s]"%(req.a, req.b, (req.a + req.b))
    return AddTwoIntsResponse(req.a + req.b)

def add_two_ints_server():
    rospy.init_node('add_two_ints_server')
    s = rospy.Service('add_two_ints', AddTwoInts, handle_add_two_ints)
    print "Ready to add two ints."
    rospy.spin()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    add_two_ints_server()
```
Don't forget to make the node executable:
```
chmod +x scripts/add_two_ints_server.py
```
### The Code Explained
Now, let's break the code down.There's very little to writing a service using rospy. We declare our node using init_node() and then declare our service:
```
s = rospy.Service('add_two_ints', AddTwoInts, handle_add_two_ints)
```
This declares a new service named add_two_ints with the AddTwoInts service type. All requests are passed to handle_add_two_ints function. handle_add_two_ints is called with instances of AddTwoIntsRequest and returns instances of AddTwoIntsResponse.

Just like with the subscriber example, rospy.spin() keeps your code from exiting until the service is shutdown.
