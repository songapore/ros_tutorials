## 12.2 Writing the Subscriber Node
### 12.2.1 The Code
Download the listener.py file into your scripts directory:
```
$ roscd beginner_tutorials/scripts/
$ wget https://raw.github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/kinetic-devel/rospy_tutorials/001_talker_listener/listener.py
```
The file contents look close to:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String

def callback(data):
    rospy.loginfo(rospy.get_caller_id() + "I heard %s", data.data)
    
def listener():

    # In ROS, nodes are uniquely named. If two nodes with the same
    # node are launched, the previous one is kicked off. The
    # anonymous=True flag means that rospy will choose a unique
    # name for our 'listener' node so that multiple listeners can
    # run simultaneously.
    rospy.init_node('listener', anonymous=True)

    rospy.Subscriber("chatter", String, callback)

    # spin() simply keeps python from exiting until this node is stopped
    rospy.spin()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    listener()
```
Don't forget to make the node executable:
```
$ chmod +x listener.py
```
### 12.2.2 The Code Explained
The code for listener.py is similar to talker.py, except we've introduced a new callback-based mechanism for subscribing to messages.
```
rospy.init_node('listener', anonymous=True)

rospy.Subscriber("chatter", String, callback)

# spin() simply keeps python from exiting until this node is stopped
rospy.spin()
```
This declares that your node subscribes to the chatter topic which is of type std_msgs.msgs.String. When new messages are received, callback is invoked with the message as the first argument.

We also changed up the call to rospy.init_node() somewhat. We've added the anonymous=True keyword argument. ROS requires that each node have a unique name. If a node with the same name comes up, it bumps the previous one. This is so that malfunctioning nodes can easily be kicked off the network. The anonymous=True flag tells rospy to generate a unique name for the node so that you can have multiple listener.py nodes run easily.

The final addition, rospy.spin() simply keeps your node from exiting until the node has been shutdown. Unlike roscpp, rospy.spin() does not affect the subscriber callback functions, as those have their own threads.
